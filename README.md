# Plotly_Deploy
Enabling the deployment of a customized dashboard through a webpage for a biodiversity data visualization.

## Project Overview
With my knowlege of knowledge of HTML and Bootstrap, the aim of this project consists in developing a biodiversity data visualization for the web.

For this task, I employed the Plotly library in Javascript to produce three fundamental diagrams: a horizontal bar chart, a gauge chart, and a bubble chart. I utilized D3.json to extract data from external sources and utilized Javascript's functional programming to modify it. I included event handlers to incorporate interactivity into the data visualization. When a user chooses a sample ID number from the drop-down menu, the graphs are created. Finally, I deployed this interactive chart on a webpage.
